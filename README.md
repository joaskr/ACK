### Acknowledgement

This is my first ever video game and I followed a tutorial from Udemy to complete it. The project took me several dozen hours and I'm quite of myself. At the end of the course, I could understand the basics of game creation and adjust the project on my own.
Kudos to AlexDev for an amazing course.
